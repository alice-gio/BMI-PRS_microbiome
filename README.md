# BMI-PRS_microbiome

In this project, we are going to build polygenic risk scores for adiposity traits and test their association with microbiota.

We will use data from Scapis and MOS. A description of the cohorts data files is found below.

a. SCAPIS
the data are found on indigo, in /gpfs/gpfs0/Raw_Data_Archive/Chip_Genotyping/SCAPIS/Raw_Content
the genotype data is in .pgen format.

b. MOS
Mos genetic data are found, on indigo, in /gpfs/gpfs0/Raw_Data_Archive/Chip_Genotyping/MOS_GWAS/Imputation/MOS-2017-2020-HRC/dbsnp156_annotated
The format is .vcf
